# Governance

`blah-code` is maintainer-led.

## Decision model

- normal changes: maintainer review + merge
- major changes (architecture/security/release): discussion first, maintainer decision
- security emergencies: maintainers may fast-track fixes

## Contribution model

- issues and PRs are welcome from everyone
- maintainers can request scope reduction for large PRs
- maintainers can close proposals that conflict with project direction

## Project priorities

1. correctness and safety
2. reliable local tool execution
3. strong developer UX
4. low-friction open source collaboration
