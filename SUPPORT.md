# Support

## Ask for help

- usage/setup questions: open a GitHub Discussion
- bugs: open a GitHub Issue using templates
- security issues: use `SECURITY.md` process

## Before opening an issue

1. read `README.md`
2. read `docs/operations.md`
3. run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`
4. include repro steps + logs (without secrets)

## Maintainer response expectations

- we try to triage new issues quickly
- response speed depends on severity and maintainer availability
